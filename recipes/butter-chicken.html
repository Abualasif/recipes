        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Butter chicken, also known as murgh makhani, is a beloved Indian dish that combines tender chicken in an indulgent tomato-based curry. Boneless chicken is marinated in a blend of yogurt and spices, then cooked until juicy. A velvety sauce is made by simmering tomatoes, butter, cream, and a melange of aromatic spices like garam masala. The rich, mildly spiced sauce clings perfectly to the chicken. Garnished with cream and butter, this decadent dish offers an explosion of flavors in every bite. Butter chicken's irresistible taste makes it a fan favorite.</p>
